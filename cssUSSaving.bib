                   consistently and actively supported financial
                   deregulation. Given the low visibility and relatively
                   technical nature of the issues, presidents saw
                   deregulation as the best way to respond to technical
                   innovation in the industry and disruptions caused by
                   inflation. This history suggests several lessons for
                   students of the role of presidents in policy making.
                   Presidents can be active in promoting policy reform
                   even though standard methods for defining the
                   presidential agenda do not reveal this fact. We see
                   presidential engagement reflected in White House
                   statements both before and after legislation is
                   passed, and in White House use of study reports and
                   messages to shape an elite consensus.},

                   movements under perfect capital mobility, a slow
                   adjustment of goods markets relative to asset
                   markets, and consistent expectations. The perfect
                   foresight path is derived and it is shown that along
                   that along that path a monetary expansion causes the
                   exchange rate to depreciate. An initial overshooting
                   of exchange rates is shown to derive from
                   differential adjustment speed of markets. The
                   magnitude and persistence of the overshooting is
                   developed in terms of the structural parameters of
                   the model. To the extent that output responds to a
                   monetary expansion in the short run, this acts a a
                   dampening effect on exchange depreciation and may, in

  abstract =      {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how
                   much, household income, wealth, and preference
                   heterogeneity amplify and propagate a macroeconomic
                   shock. We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of
                   2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
                   from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document
                   the patterns of household income, consumption and
                   wealth inequality before and during the Great
                   Recession. We then investigate how households in
                   different segments of the wealth distribution were
                   affected by income declines, and how they changed
                   their expenditures differentially during the
                   aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we
                   study several variants of a standard heterogeneous
                   household model with aggregate shocks and an
                   endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our
                   key finding is that wealth inequality can
                   significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate
                   shock, and it does so if the distribution features a
                   sufficiently large fraction of households with very
                   little net worth that sharply increase their saving
                   (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the recession
                   hits. We document that both these features are
                   observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role
                   that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
                   insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income
                   and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics
                   of business cycles.},

                   policy for household consumption in a Heterogeneous
                   Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. The model yields
                   empirically realistic distributions of household
                   wealth and marginal propensities to consume because
                   of two key features: multiple assets with different
                   degrees of liquidity and an idiosyncratic income
                   process with leptokurtic income changes. In this
                   environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected
                   cut in interest rates, which operate through a
                   general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far
                   outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal
                   substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to
                   small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New
                   Keynesian (RANK) economies, where intertemporal

                   banking restrictions on interstate personal income
                   insurance for the period 1970 to 2001. Interstate
                   income insurance occurs when personal income reacts
                   less than one-to-one to state-specific output shocks.
                   We find that insurance improved after banking
                   deregulation, with a larger effect in states where
                   small businesses are more important and on
                   proprietors' income than on other components of
                   personal income. Our explanation centers on the role
                   of banks as a prime source of small business finance
                   and on the close intertwining of the personal and

                   financial crisis on Canada's potential GDP growth.
                   Using a simple accounting framework to decompose
                   trend GDP growth into changes in capital, labor
                   services and total factor productivity, we find a
                   sizeable drop in Canadian potential growth in the
                   short term. The estimated decline of about 1
                   percentage point originates from a sharply
                   decelerating capital stock accumulation (as
                   investment has dropped steeply) and a rising
                   long-term unemployment rate (which would raise
                   equilibrium unemployment rates). However, over the
                   medium term, we expect Canada's potential GDP growth
                   to gradually rise to around 2 percent, below the
                   pre-crisis growth rate, mostly reflecting the effects
                   of population aging and a secular decline in average
