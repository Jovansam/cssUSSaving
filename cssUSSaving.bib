  abstract =      {Between 1980 and the early 1990s the variability of
                   labor earnings growth rates across the prime-age
                   working population fell significantly. This decline
                   and timing are consistent with other macro and micro
                   observations about growth variability that are
                   collectively referred to as the \&quot;Great
                   Moderation.\&quot; The variability of earnings growth
                   is negatively correlated with age at any point in
                   time, and the U.S. working age population got older
                   during this period because the Baby Boom was aging.
                   However, the decrease in variability was roughly
                   uniform across all age groups, so population aging is
                   not the source of the overall decline. The variance
                   of log changes also declined at multi-year
                   frequencies in such a way as to suggest that both
                   permanent and transitory components of earnings
                   shocks became more moderate. A simple identification
                   strategy for separating age and cohort effects shows
                   a very intuitive pattern of permanent and transitory
                   shocks over the life cycle, and confirms that a shift
                   over time in the stochastic process occurred even
                   after controlling for age effects.},
