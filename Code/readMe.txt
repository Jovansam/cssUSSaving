		Use Stata 9.0 to run them and make sure the variable basePath (eg, global basePath "C:\Jirka\Research\cssUSSaving\20120627";) contains the correct path to the archive
		* drawMotivationGraphs.do	Generates Figure 1
		* tableRFregressions_base.do	Generates Figures 9, 10, 15 and Tables 1, 4 and 6
		* tableRFregressions_rob.do	Generates Figures 6, 7 and 8, and Tables 2 and 3
		* tableDispIncome.do		Generates Figures 16 and 17, and Tables 7 and 8
