The code for solving the theoretical model here is an "Example" in the archive of code for the paper "A Tractable Model of Buffer Stock Saving" by Carroll and Toche.  

Updated versions of that archive should be available at http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/code/BufferStockTractable.zip

To execute the code, open the notebook ./Examples/cssUSSaving/doAll.nb
